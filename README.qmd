The in this repo is intended to demonstrate how to use [`od2net`](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics-Technology-Platform/od2net) to generate route networks and to compare the workflow, and results, with the R-based approach currently used in the NPT project.

# od2net minimum example

The following is based on [`od2net`'s docs](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics-Technology-Platform/od2net/blob/main/docs/tutorial_examples.md#running-the-edinburgh-example) and the code in the examples/edinburgh folder.

We will run the code on a computer with Ubuntu 22.04.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
gh repo clone Urban-Analytics-Technology-Platform/od2net
# Copy the example to this folder:
cp -r od2net/examples/edinburgh .
```
